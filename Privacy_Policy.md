Welcome to RoadLedger. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

When using RoadLedger, you may provide us with certain information, including:

- **Account Information**: Email address and authentication credentials when you create an account or sign in using Apple, Google, or email/password authentication.

- **Expense Data**: Financial transactions, expense amounts, categories, descriptions, locations, and recurring expense preferences.

### Information Collected Automatically

- **Usage Data**: We may collect information about how you use the app, including features accessed and time spent.
- **Device Information**: We collect device-specific information such as your operating system version, device type, and system preferences.
- **Crash Reports**: We collect crash reports and diagnostic data to improve app stability and performance. This data may include device model, iOS version, and stack traces but does not include personal trip or financial data.

## How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide and maintain the app's core functionality
- Sync your data securely across your devices via cloud backup
- Calculate and display financial summaries, trip analytics, and expense reports
- Improve the app's features and user experience
- Process and complete subscription transactions
- Troubleshoot and resolve technical issues
- Monitor app performance and fix crashes

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage
Your data is stored locally on your device using Apple's secure storage systems.

### Cloud Storage (Firebase)
When you create an account or sign in, your data is securely synced to Google Firebase services:

- **Firebase Authentication**: Manages your account credentials securely
- **Firebase Firestore**: Stores your trip and expense data with encryption in transit and at rest
- **Firebase Crashlytics**: Collects anonymous crash reports to help us improve app stability

Your data in Firebase is:
- Encrypted in transit using TLS/SSL
- Encrypted at rest
- Accessible only to you when signed into your account
- Stored in compliance with Google's security standards

### Anonymous Users
If you use the app without creating an account, your data is stored locally and may be synced to a temporary anonymous account. This data can be transferred to a permanent account when you sign in.

### Offline Support
RoadLedger supports offline usage. Your data is cached locally and automatically synced when an internet connection is available.

## Subscription Services

RoadLedger offers premium subscription options. Payment processing is handled securely through Apple's App Store using StoreKit. We do not have access to your complete payment information.

## Data Sharing and Third Parties

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. We may share limited data with:

- **Apple's App Store**: For subscription processing
- **Google Firebase**: For secure cloud storage, authentication, and crash reporting
- **Analytics providers**: Anonymous usage data to help us improve the app (without personally identifiable information)

## Authentication Providers

When you sign in using third-party providers:

- **Apple Sign In**: We receive only the information you authorize (email, name)
- **Google Sign In**: We receive only the information you authorize (email, name, profile picture)

We do not have access to your passwords for these services.

## Location Information

While RoadLedger allows you to enter origin and destination information for trips, the app does not actively track your location or use GPS functionality unless explicitly permitted.

## Your Rights and Choices

You have the right to:

- Access, update, or delete your personal information stored in the app
- Export your data as PDF reports
- Sign out and remove your data from cloud storage
- Choose between keeping local data, cloud data, or merging both when signing into an existing account
- Opt out of crash reporting (by not using the app)
- Cancel your subscription through your Apple App Store settings

## Data Retention

- **Local Data**: Remains on your device until you delete the app or clear app data
- **Cloud Data**: Remains in your account until you request deletion or delete your account
- **Crash Reports**: Retained for up to 90 days to analyze and fix issues
